Early detection is crucial to being able to treat cancer before it develops into more serious stages. This can prevent the need for serious treatment and can save your life. Click on the videos in this slide to further explore why breast cancer is important and why it is important for Black women. Many experts advise to begin annual screening at 40 years old. Once you turn 55, expert advise getting screened every two years. Once you turn 70, expert advise you should continue getting screened every two years. If you are feeling healthy and would pursue treatment if diagnosed with breast cancer. Self breast exams do not replace the need for regular mammograms. However, it is important to feel empowered to know how your breasts and body feel on a regular basis. That way, if you do experience changes, you will be able to notice them. Not all changes are bad, but if you are able to notice changes in your body, you are better able to discuss them with your health care provider who can help you understand the reasons for the changes."}

Getting regular exercise is an important part of keeping healthy breasts. Exercise can help you stay at a healthy weight, keep your hormones balanced, and boost your immune system. Getting exercise doesn't have to be complicated. It can be as simple as a quick walk, cleaning your home, or chasing around the little ones. Click on the link at the bottom of the slide to learn about great walking routines. Along with regular exercise, eating healthy is an important part of maintaining healthy breasts. Try adding more fruits and vegetables to your diet. For example, try replacing your dessert with a piece of fruit or adding a side of vegetables to your lunch. Click on the link at the bottom of the slide to learn about a great walking routine. Limit alcohol. Limiting alcohol is an important part of living a healthy lifestyle. Alcohol can cause weight gain, change your hormones, which is why it can increase your risk for developing breast cancer. The American Cancer Society recommends avoiding alcohol as much as possible and says that if you choose to drink alcohol, limit it to one drink per day. Think carefully about using hormonal replacement therapy, which is HRT. Think carefully about using hormonal replacement therapy. Increasing the amount of certain hormones in the body can increase the risk of breast cancer. Before starting hormone replacement therapy, speak with a health care provider about the pros and the cons. Get screened! One of the best things you can do to keep your breasts healthy is to get screened. Regular screening can help healthcare providers pitch signs of breast cancer in its earlier stages, which makes the disease easier to treat. In the next module, you will learn more about breast cancer screening and the benefits of getting screened regularly."}

We don't know what specifically causes breast cancer, but we do know that some factors can contribute to the development of the disease. cancer arises because of the combination of both external and internal factors the external factor is the term used to describe a cause that happens outside of the body The internal factor is the term that is used to describe the cause that occurred inside the body. External and internal factors can work together or in sequence to initiate the development of cancer. In the next few slides, we will explore common external and internal factors. According to the American Cancer Society, common internal factors that contribute to cancer are hormones and genetics, specifically a person's family history. For example, if your mother, sister, or daughter has had breast cancer, you are at higher risk of developing the disease.

My name is Thelma Dukley and I am a breast cancer champion. Before beginning this video, please download and open the slides so you can follow along. Anyone can develop cancer. Half of all men in America and one-third of all women will develop cancer at some point in their lifetime. Older individuals are more likely to develop cancer than younger individuals. The graph on this slide demonstrates how the risk for developing cancer changes throughout a person's lifetime. Having female breast tissue is one of the most significant risks of developing breast cancer. As a result, one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. Along with having female breast tissues, another significant risk for developing breast cancer is aging. The statistics above demonstrate how your risk for developing breast cancer changes if you are born a female and throughout your life. Remember learning about the external and internal causes of cancer. Being associated with these causes increase your risk for developing breast cancer. Avid dense breast tissue increases your risk for developing breast cancer. This is because cancer is harder to spot during screening in dense breast tissue compared with non-dense breast tissues. The white part of the mammogram represents breast tissue that has potential to develop breast cancer. The dark parts are fat. The more white the mammogram appears, the more density the breast has. Hey, watch the video on this slide to learn more about breast density."}

Welcome to the first presentation in Understanding Cancer. My name is ______ and I’m a Breast Cancer Champion. Before beginning this video, please download and open the slides so you can follow along!\nSlide 4: What is a cell\nRead: Cells are the building blocks of the human body and control all of the functions of the human body. A group of cells is called tissue. A group of tissue makes up an organ. A group of organs makes up the human body.\nSlide 5: Cells\nRead: Cancer occurs when cells in the body become abnormal and grow out of control. When cells begin acting irregularly and grow out of control, they begin to disrupt normal cellular functions that are needed for survival. \nSlide 6: Abnormal Cells\nRead: A growth of cells is not always considered to be cancerous. When abnormal cells do not invade other areas and do not spread to other parts of the body they are not considered cancerous. When abnormal cells do not remain in one spot but rather move away from where they started, they are considered cancerous. Cancerous cells can travel to parts of the body that are far from the location they started, which impacts other bodily functions. For example, when cancer moves from the breast to the liver it can begin impacting normal liver functions.\nSlide 7: Dandelion \nRead: Imagine a dandelion spreading its seeds in the wind. Cancerous cells can move through your bloodstream to grow in other parts of the body like dandelion seeds move through wind to grow in other parts of the field.\nSlide 8: Take a deeper dive\nRead: Gain a better understanding about cancer and how it develops by watching the following videos. Click on the videos in your copy of the slides to watch. \nSlide 9: What is breast cancer?\nRead: The type of cancer is determined by the location of the body where cells begin to grow abnormally. Therefore breast cancer is when the abnormal cellular growth begins in the breast. Breast cancer can develop in different parts of the breast. Most breast cancers begin in the ducts that carry breast milk to the nipple, this is called invasive ductal carcinoma. Some begin in the glands that make breast milk, this is called invasive lobular carcinoma. While these are the most common, there are a small number of cancers that occur in other areas of the breast.\nSlide 10: Common Symptoms of Breast Cancer\nRead: Similar to general symptoms of cancer, there is no one symptom that is indicative of breast cancer. However, the symptoms listed above are important to look out for. Dimpling is when indentations appear on or around your breast. A lump on your breast may feel like a swollen area that feels harder than other areas of the breast. Lymph discharge is when a clear or milky liquid comes out of the nipple. Texture change can be any changes to the outside of the breast around the nipple; for example, having dry or scale-like skin. Nipple inversion is when the nipple points inwards or lies flat rather than points outwards. Lastly, bloody discharge is when fluid with blood comes out of the nipple. If you notice a symptom shown above on your breast or experience any other changes on your breast, discuss the change with a health care provider. The goal of breast cancer screening is to catch the cancer before these symptoms appear!\nSlide 11: Take a deeper dive\nRead: As you can see from the above list from the American Cancer Association, there are many symptoms that have been associated with cancer. Unfortunately, there is no one obvious symptom of cancer. Many symptoms that people experience when they have cancer can be caused by a variety of other things. If you are experiencing a symptom for a prolonged period of time, call your doctor and they will work to understand the cause of the symptoms."}

Welcome to the fourth presentation in Understanding Cancer. My name is (NAME) and I’m a Breast Cancer Champion. Before beginning this video, please download and open the slides so you can follow along!\nSlide 2: What is a health inequality?\nREAD: A health inequality is an unjust and avoidable difference in the health of different groups of people. There are several health inequalities in breast cancer. \nSlide 3: Female breast cancer mortality\nREAD: One of the most significant inequalities in breast cancer is that Black women die at a higher rate from the disease than white women. \nSlide 4: Why does this health inequality exist\nREAD: There is not one single reason that explains why Black women die at a higher rate than other groups. Rather it is a combination of different factors that cause the inequality. These factors include social factors, economic factors, and individual behaviors. We will explore each of these factors in this video.\nSlide 5: Health Inequalities social\nREAD: Social factors that contribute to health inequalities are called social inequalities. Some social inequalities that contribute to cancer inequalities include differences in treatment, culture, and language. Differences in treatment mean that people may not have the same access to good health care as others. This includes access to insurance, health care providers, and medications. Culture can contribute to health inequalities because different cultures approach health differently. For example, if a head of household makes the decisions, the health of others in the house may be overlooked or there may be more stigma or fear surrounding breast cancer. Women may also prioritize the health of others and not seek health care for themselves. And finally, language can contribute to health inequalities because it can act as a barrier to understanding your health and accessing the correct services if you do not live in a country where your primary language is spoken. \nSlide 6: Health Inequalities Economics\nREAD: Economic factors that contribute to health inequalities are called economic inequalities. Some of the economic inequalities that contribute to inequalities in breast cancer are the high cost of cancer treatments and the time and resources it takes to get treatment. There is a high cost of health services in America; this cost includes the costs of health insurance and additional payments. If you can pay for treatment, it takes a lot of time and resources to be able to receive cancer treatment. You have to have the ability to travel for screening and treatment and your job has to allow for time to travel and receive treatment. Working multiple jobs can make this even more difficult. In summary, not all people have equal access to afford or receive cancer treatments which means that some people are more likely to die from the disease. \nSlide 7: Health Inequalities Behavioral\nREAD: Individual behaviors also contribute to health inequalities. It is important to note that individual behaviors are closely connected to economic and social inequalities. For example, due to social and economic inequalities, some people experience more stress than others, which increases their risk for developing breast cancer. Another example is that not all people have equal access to spaces to exercise and healthy food to eat, which both help to prevent breast cancer. Lastly, not all people have time and resources to dedicate to health behaviors. For example, people who have two jobs for economic reasons have less time to exercise or cook a healthy meal.   \nSlide 8: Take a deeper dive\nREAD: Watch the video on this slide to learn more about health inequalities!"}

Health care providers use special imaging techniques to see these signs.\nSlide 5: Two main types of screening\nREAD: Mammography is the most common type of screening, it is used for every person with breast tissue at a specific age. While regular mammograms cannot prevent the development of breast cancer, it is the best way to prevent more serious forms of cancer from developing, which is life-saving.\nSlide 6: Two main types of screening\nREAD: A less common form of screening is called a breast MRI. Breast MRIs are primarily used for those at especially high risk of developing cancer in addition to regular mammograms.\nSlide 7: Two main types of screening\nREAD: There are many factors that can contribute to being considered high-risk. These factors include: having a history of breast cancer in your immediate family, having a history of breast cancer yourself, having dense breasts that make mammograms less effective by themselves, having a specific hereditary gene that increases your risk of developing breast cancer.

When you go into a mammogram you remove any clothing and undergarments covering your breast and change into the cover-up provided by the clinic. You then put one breast on a plastic platform and the health care provider will lower a plastic plate onto your breast, this will allow an image to be taken of your breast cancer tissue. The process will then be repeated with the other breast. A health care provider will then carefully look at the images for possible signs of breast cancer.  \nSlide 3: Take a deeper dive\nREAD: Watch the video on this slide to learn what to expect during a mammogram!\nSlide 4: What happens during an MRI?\nREAD: If you would like to learn more about what happens during an MRI, watch the video in this slide!"}

Black women face economic inequalities that create unequal barriers to screening and Black women are more likely to distrust the health care system because of instances of oppression in medicine that have unjustly targeted Black communities. Additionally, some women may also have cultural differences, for example traditions that place reliance on religion over receiving health care, which may prevent them from accessing screening. Lastly, some women do not have easy access to breast cancer screening whether it is because they experience difficulty traveling to mammogram facilities, do not receive interpretation services, or do not have access to a primary care provider that can help refer them to mammogram and cancer care services.\nSlide 4: Take a deeper dive!\nREAD: Learn more about the inequalities in breast cancer screening facing Black women by hearing from the President of the Black Women’s Health Imperative in the video on this slide.\nSlide 5: What can I do to help?\nREAD: You can help those in your community get screened!

My name is (NAME) and I’m a Breast Cancer Champion. Before beginning this video, please download and open the slides so you can follow along!\nSlide 4: What is effective communication?\nREAD: Effective communication is when you, the health educator, establish a good level of understanding with your audience, or community members.\nSlide 5: What is effective communication?\nREAD: There are 3 main parts of effective communication. The first is to be a good listener. This means listening to your audience’s current thoughts on breast cancer and breast cancer screening. This will help you understand their understanding level, concerns, and beliefs. The second is to have a judgement-free conversation for understanding. Everyone approaches the topic of breast cancer differently depending on many factors such as their previous experiences, cultural beliefs, and education. And the final part is to be clear. Breast cancer is a complex subject. Make your words as simple and clear as possible to help your audience understand difficult concepts. \nSlide 6: Why is communication important?\nREAD: Maslow’s Triangle is a theory in psychology that explains a person’s needs and their behavior. The theory says that there are specific needs that must be met before a person can consider or learn about complicated topics. So, the basic needs at the bottom of the triangle such as food, sleep, and security need to be fulfilled before the needs at the top of the triangle can be fulfilled. \nSlide 7: Why is communication important?\nREAD: Breast cancer education is similar to Maslow’s triangle. It may be difficult for community members to focus on breast cancer and screening when their other needs are not met. And effective communication is important because it can help the educator better understand if their listener has the capacity to learn about breast cancer in that moment.\nSlide 8: Take a deeper dive\nREAD: Watch this video to learn about the recipe for great communication."}

Welcome to the third presentation in Communication. My name is (NAME) and I’m a Breast Cancer Champion. Before beginning this video, please download and open the slides so you can follow along!\nSlide 2: Potential Barriers\nREAD: There are barriers you can face when trying to communicate effectively with a peer, or community member. One of the barriers is talking more than listening. This can prevent you from fully understanding your peers and can impact your ability to form a relationship with them. But there is more than one way to overcome this barrier. To avoid talking more than listening, use your active listening skills, try listening twice as much as you speak, and focus on the needs and words of others. One quote that demonstrates this idea is “We have two ears and one mouth so we can listen twice as much as we speak”. \nSlide 3: Potential Barriers\nREAD: Another barrier is struggles with differences in beliefs. Everyone has different beliefs and values surrounding their health decisions. And health topics are difficult to talk about, especially with people who may think differently than you. To overcome this barrier, keep the following in mind: It is normal to have differing opinions! Accept the differences and focus on the commonalities. And make sure to provide and safe, judgment-free space to speak about differing opinions and values.\nSlide 4: Potential Barriers\nREAD: Misunderstandings are another potential barrier to effective communication. This happens because breast cancer is complicated! And it’s easy to experience misunderstands when discussing a complicated and sensitive topic. You can overcome this by being patient because everyone learns differently and at a different pace. Also, use simple language and provide different methods of communication such as spoken information and written information, like flyers or infographics.\nSlide 5: Potential Barriers\nREAD: The final potential barrier that we will cover is judgment. This is a barrier because if someone feels judged, they are less likely to communicate effectively. You can overcome judgment by being reflective on your feelings during conversations. And if you find yourself having judgment for someone, find ways to change your perspective such as learning more about the speaker and practicing opening up to others’ experiences. \nSlide 6: Take a deeper dive\nREAD: Watch these two videos to learn more about miscommunication and how to avoid it, and learn about other barriers to communication and how to overcome them."}
